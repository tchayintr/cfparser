# Yet another syntactic parser built for Thai
### **[CFParser.org](https://cfparser.org)**

CF stands for Cassia fistula, the national tree and national flower of Thailand. We originally aim to annotate syntactic trees for Thai language by composing a metaphor that we are planting trees for our nation towards Thai Computational Linguistics advancement.

To fasten syntactic structure construction, particularly syntactic treebank, we willingly introduce a so-called CFParser, web-service for syntactic parsing to exclusively integrates with **[CFparser.org](https://cfparser.org)**, implement with passion for researchers and enthusiasts.
